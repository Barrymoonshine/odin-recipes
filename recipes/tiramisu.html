    <h3 class="heading-three">Ingredients</h3>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <ul>
            <li>400ml double cream</li>
            <li>250g mascarpone</li>
            <li>75ml marsala wine</li>
            <li>5 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>300ml coffee, made with 2 tbsp coffee granules and 300ml boiling water</li>
            <li>175g sponge fingers</li>
            <li>25g dark chocolate</li>
            <li>2tsp cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="heading-two">Method</h3>
    <div class="wrapper-two">
        <ol>
            <li>Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until youâ€™ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.</li>
            <li>Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</li>
            <li>Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.</li>
            <li>To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</li>
        </ol>
